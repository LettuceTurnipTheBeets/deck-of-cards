# deck-of-cards
This program is a python solution for the problem posted here: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/160427/deck-of-cards-as-an-interview-exercise

## Goal
Write a simple class in the language of your choice to represent a deck of cards with operations to shuffle the deck and to deal one card. While not a requirement today, a likely future enhancement is the need to deal all the cards
in a deck. While not strictly required, we value usage instructions, nicely-modeled data, automated tests, andthoughtful consideration of architectural decisions and simplicity-vs-completeness trade-offs.

## Example
